      <p>The need to document the art before it is washed away, cleaned up or painted over, derives out of the transient nature of the spray paint on walls. In that way, the photographs of worldwide urban art live forever. The images of tagged New York Subways, Berlin’s murals, Paris’ mosaics or London’s painted brick walls have been captured and shared with thousands of people, keeping at least the images of street art in the mind of urban art admirers. The people that ensure that street art is archived are amateur photographers, photojournalists and artists, sometimes anonymous, sometimes well-known, usually street artists themselves. These documenters don't merely capture the photo of graffiti or a mural, they portray the quirks of a city, the action of graffiti writing, the atmosphere, the sprayer's complicated feelings towards danger, the wish to create art and the lengths they will go through in order to do it. These 10 photographers try to convey a deeper message and change our perception of the people and urban landscapes that surround us. They bring out the beauty of street art in all its glory</p>
